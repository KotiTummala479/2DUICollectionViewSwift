# 2DUICollectionViewSwift
A simple and elegant 2Dimensional UICollectionView (Horizontal and Vertical) which is most commonly used in ecommerce apps, music streaming apps etc. Easily customisable as per your requirements as it is designed keeping the superset requirement in mind. Developed in latest Swift syntax.

As it can be observed in current day's apps where one is not sure about number of sections and number of items in each section till he recieves the response via API call, this project can be taken as reference to present the UI in an elegant way.
I've used a static JSON file to populate the UI but you can easily replace it with your own JSON and customise it as per your requirements.
Inspired from apps like Saavn, EPIC.
